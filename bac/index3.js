Recommended Resources for Creating a Medication Prescription
If you are looking to create a Medication Prescription, I would recommend these three books and here is exactly why.

The Complete Guide to Prescription and Nonprescription Drugs by H. Winter Griffith: This book provides comprehensive information on prescription and nonprescription drugs, making it an essential reference for physicians. It includes indications, dosages, side effects, and drug interactions, allowing physicians to make informed decisions when selecting medications. The book also offers guidance on selecting the appropriate medication based on the patient's condition and medical history, ensuring personalized treatment plans. Additionally, it includes clear instructions on dosage administration, frequency, and duration of treatment, helping physicians prescribe medications accurately. The book highlights important precautions and warnings to ensure safe medication use, promoting patient safety. Moreover, it follows medical guidelines and provides evidence-based information to support accurate and appropriate treatment.
The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy by David N. Gilbert: Antibiotic prescribing is a crucial aspect of medical practice, and this book focuses specifically on antimicrobial therapy. It provides up-to-date information on the selection, dosing, and administration of antibiotics, ensuring physicians have the latest knowledge in this field. The book offers guidance on appropriate antibiotic choices based on the type of infection, patient characteristics, and local resistance patterns, enabling physicians to make informed decisions. It includes detailed dosing recommendations for different patient populations, such as children, pregnant women, and patients with renal impairment, ensuring optimal antibiotic use. The book also emphasizes the importance of antibiotic stewardship and the prevention of antibiotic resistance, promoting responsible prescribing practices. With concise and practical information, this book supports accurate and effective antibiotic prescribing.
The Art of Prescribing by Nicholas H. G. Holford: Prescribing medications is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors. This book explores the principles and strategies of prescribing medications, providing valuable insights for physicians. It discusses the importance of considering patient factors, such as age, weight, renal and hepatic function, and comorbidities, when prescribing medications, ensuring personalized treatment plans. The book also provides insights into pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, optimizing drug selection and dosing for individual patients. It emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of medication regimens based on patient response and therapeutic goals, promoting patient safety and efficacy. With practical tips and frameworks, this book enhances prescribing skills and improves patient outcomes.
In conclusion, these three books are highly relevant for physicians creating medication prescriptions. They provide comprehensive information on drugs, offer guidance on appropriate medication choices, highlight precautions and warnings, and emphasize the importance of personalized treatment plans and ongoing monitoring. By utilizing these references, physicians can enhance their prescribing skills and ensure accurate and effective medication prescriptions.
Key Terms
Dosage: The prescribed amount of medication to be taken at a given time, usually expressed in milligrams or milliliters.
Frequency: The number of times a medication should be taken within a specified period, such as daily, twice daily, or every four hours.
Route of Administration: The method by which a medication is delivered into the body, such as orally, topically, or intravenously.
Duration: The length of time for which a medication should be taken, specified in days, weeks, or months.
Contraindications: Specific conditions or factors that make a particular medication potentially harmful or ineffective, such as allergies or pre-existing medical conditions.

###Make sure to return only medication prescription, no other text should be returned.
###This is an example output: 
1. Tab Ibuprofen (400mg), take one tablet every 8 hours as needed for pain, after meals

2. Tab Vitamin D3 (1000 IU), once daily with food

3. X-ray of the lumbar spine to assess any structural issues

4. MRI of the lumbar spine if X-ray is inconclusive or if symptoms persist

###Make sure to return only bullet points, and the content in the same format as above example output.

        const advicePrompt = `The following text is a medical summary ${summary} of the patient. You have to give medical advice only to the patient based on summary and prescriptions ${prescriptions}. Based  on medical summary and prescriptions you have to give lifestyle advice to the patient.
